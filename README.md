This research aims to validate the efficacy of advanced machine learning techniques combined with satellite imagery for precise estimation of critical Maternal and Child Health (MCH) indicators across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The hypothesis asserts that leveraging publicly available geotagged data can yield insightful village and neighborhood-level MCH indicators, encompassing child undernutrition, anemia prevalence, child and maternal mortality rates, and childhood illness episodes.
The report presents a meticulously designed experimental framework to achieve this objective. In the context of global health, accurate identification of regions requiring heightened attention and resources holds significant importance for optimizing outcomes. By integrating cutting-edge Machine learning models with ElasticNet, our project harnesses technological advancements and satellite data to achieve unparalleled accuracy in projecting health indicators. Rigorous experimentation and cross-validation enhance the credibility of our findings.
Our research advances health indicator projection and redefines healthcare planning and resource allocation. This recalibration has the potential to enhance global health outcomes significantly. Accurate predictive models utilizing satellite data represent a milestone with far-reaching implications for targeted interventions and amplified global health improvements.
